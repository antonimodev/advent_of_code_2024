[Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

#### Part 2
The task is to **determine how often each number from the left list appears in the right list**. Then, calculate a total similarity score by summing each number in the left list multiplied by the frequency of its occurrences in the right list.
